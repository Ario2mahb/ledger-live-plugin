# ClearSign for Ledger app-plugin-venus

This repo contains a ClearSign ledger plugin for the Venus Protocol smart contract on BnbChain.

Plugins are lightweight applications that go hand-in-hand with the Ethereum
Application on a Nano S, SP, X and Stax device.

They allow users to safely interact with smart contracts by parsing the
transaction data and displaying its content in a human readable way. This is
done on a "per contract" basis, meaning a plugin is required for every DApp.

## Ethereum SDK

Ethereum/BnbChain plugins need the [Ethereum SDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ethereum-plugin-sdk).
You can use the `ETHEREUM_PLUGIN_SDK` variable to point to the directory where you cloned this repository. By default, the `Makefile` expects it to be at the root directory of this plugin repository, by the `ethereum-plugin-sdk` name.

This repository is deliberately **not** a submodule. You can see that the CI workflows clone and checkout either the latest `master` or on `develop` references. This ensures the code is compiled and tested on the latest version of the SDK.
